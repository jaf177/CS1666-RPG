# CS1666-RPG: Assignment README

### Should describe the game being produced (GOALS)

Turn-based combat, real-time overworld RPG/JRPG (roguelite/rougue-like). Interactive co-op (2+) i.e. multiplayer.  

Character development focus on stats, ~~level progression should feel significant but not overpowered. Items/equipment should influence combat.~~

Top-down overworld aspect for level/map exploration and enemy encounter/engagement. 

Side-view combat aspect with 3-d animations/graphics. Co-op combat.

### Should state the goals for this game for the term (i.e., what criteria must be met for the term project to be complete)

Dynamic/varied level progression (i.e. replay value). Early character decisions impact optimal playstyle. A significant difference in stats between two characters ought to imply a significant difference in playstyle.

Combat and overworld NPC interaction with player influenced/dictated by NPC artificial intellegence. Different 'classes' of enemy NPC will attack/run-away from player according to the NPC's strengths/weaknesses. i.e. an agile monster w/ low hp might flee from player; whereas, a slow, high hp monster would meander directly toward player.
Primary focus upon NPC decision-making/strategy during combat (NPC overworld ai will mostly be concerned with movement relative to player)

3-D graphics provide implicit emphasis on significant events/actions i.e. special animation for powerful/unqiue abilities

Note: story will be minimal, focus placed upon overworld/combat aspects.

### Should describe the 3 advanced topics that will be implemented for the game

1. Artificial Intelligence: overworld NPC movement/combat initiation

2. Advanced Computer Graphics: 3-D effects in combat

3. Multiplayer Networking: enable player co-op

### Should list which students are working on each advanced topic subteam

1. AI: Senjun (Justin) Fan, Austin Himler, James Finkel

2. Graphics: Brandon Badger, Mitchell Leng, Kexin (Bruce) Wang, Sanketh Kolli

3. Networking: David (Sam) Gorny, Ryan Killen, Jake Himes

currently unassigned: 

### Should describe what organizational approaches the team will take over the term
### e.g. 
####    a) Will Slack or equivalent be used for project discussion? 

Slack will be used for a group-wide dicussions/announcements (group channel). Additional sub-channels will be dedicated to each subteam for advanced topic collaboration.
        
####    b) *What development methodologies will be used (if any)?  

Agile software development (i.e. scrum from HBO's Silicon Valley)

####    c) *What coding style will be followed?
